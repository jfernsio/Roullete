# How Roullete Works

1. **Color Bets**: Players can bet on either black or red numbers.
2. **Even/Odd Bets**: Players can bet on whether the winning number will be even or odd.
3. **Row Bets**: Players can bet on which row (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) the winning number will fall into.
4. **Number Range Bets**: Players can bet on ranges of numbers (1-12, 13-24, 25-36).
5. **Single Number Bets**: Players can bet on individual numbers from 0 to 36.

Each type of bet has its own payout multiplier:
- Color, Even/Odd bets: 2x winnings
- Row bets, Number range bets: 3x winnings
- Single number bets: 36x winnings

The roulette wheel spins for 10 seconds . The wheel then gives out results, and payouts are calculated based on the type of bet placed and the outcome of the spin.
